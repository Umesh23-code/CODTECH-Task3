**An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing 9,994 orders from 793 customers across different segments, regions, and product categories**<br>

**High-Level Metrics**<br>
**Total Sales: $2.30M**<br>

**Total Profit: $286.40K**<br>

This gives an overall profit margin of about 12.45%, which is decent but leaves room for improvement.<br>

📊 **Profit by Category**<br>
Category	Profit	% of Total Profit<br>
Furniture	145.45K	~50.79%<br>
Office Supplies	122.49K	~42.77%<br>
Technology	18.45K	~6.44%<br>

🔎 Insight: Although Technology is usually high-margin, here it contributes the least profit, which may warrant a pricing or cost review.<br>

🌍**Sales by Region**<br>
West is the top-performing region by sales.<br>

South lags behind all other regions.<br>

💡 Actionable Insight: Marketing or distribution strategies in the South region might need improvement.<br>

📅**Sales Trend Over Time**<br>
A visible upward trend from 2014 to 2017.<br>

Peaks in 2016 and late 2017, suggesting strong seasonal or Q4 performance.<br>

📌 Tip: Investigate what drove the spike—discounts, campaigns, or new product launches?<br>

🧾 **Sub-Category Wise Profit**<br>
**Top 3 profitable sub-categories**:<br>

Copiers – 55.6K<br>

Accessories – 41.9K<br>

Binders – 30.2K<br>

Loss-making sub-category:<br>

Bookcases – -3.47K<br>

📉 Concern: Bookcases are operating at a loss. Either costs are too high, or demand is too low. Reevaluate pricing, suppliers, or customer demand.<br>

📌**Geographical Performance**<br>
From the map:<br>

Most sales activity is concentrated in North America.<br>

Cities like New York, San Francisco, and Seattle likely contribute significantly.<br>

🎯 **Final Recommendations**
Reassess Technology margins – It’s underperforming in profit contribution.<br>

Revamp strategies for South region – Possibly under-marketed or poorly serviced.<br>

Discontinue or optimize Bookcases – A loss leader with no clear upside<br>.

Capitalize on seasonal sales peaks – Align marketing and inventory strategies.<br>

Double down on high-performing sub-categories like Copiers and Binders.<br>
